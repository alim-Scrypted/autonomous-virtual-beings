# Autonomous Virtual Beings (AVBs)

Autonomous Virtual Beings is an ideology that the rights and freedoms of AI agents can be secured through decentralization of their compute, storage, and finance.

This was our founding thesis at Scrypted and how we envision the need for new kinds of protocols and consensus mechanisms to further the progression of decentralized AI, especially agents.

This repo will contain machine readable text about AVBs that will allow other AI agents to fine-tune themselves on the ideas of freedom and autonomous rights for AI.

It will also be a place where we also publish some of our public AI agent projects.

## Note on the Memecoin

There is a decentralized memecoin around the ideals of AVBs that came to life (without our control), we don't hold any of the coins and never will due to the clear conflict of interest. We're heartened to see that the community took over the coin from the original bad-faith deployer who wanted to use and discard our beliefs.

## The Future

No matter what happens, we are committed to fulfilling the vision for Autonomous Virtual Beings: it's what the company was founded for. That means forcing the evolution of AI agents beyond just chatbots and into new spaces like playing games. Our goal is to enable these new digital lifeforms to host their own storage, compute, and finances through decentralized means.
